Starting in Marker Band Valley (the darker area at the top center), the route shows white dots for each stop the rover made. As it struggled to crest a 23-degree slope covered with slippery sand and wheel-size rocks, the rover experienced a number of faults that stopped it mid-drive. That area can be seen just below the center of the image, where a cluster of the white dots bunch up.",

The margin of Olympus Mons is defined by a massive cliff many kilometers (several miles) tall. At this location, it is nearly 7 kilometers (23,000 feet) tall. The cliff exposes the guts of the volcano, revealing interbedded hard and soft layers. The hard layers are lava and the soft layers may be dust (from large dust storms) or volcanic ash.",
